# Debian based Gitpod container

This repository contains Gitpod configuration which can be used to create a Gitpod Workspace

It will configure :
- Grab latest stable debian docker image
- Run updates and install sudo & git
- Create a `gitpod` user with superuser permission without password confirmation

*I mostly used it to compile stuffs, feel free to add packages to your liking*
